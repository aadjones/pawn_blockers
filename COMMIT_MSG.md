## Major: Refactor to cohort-based analysis system

### ✨ Features Added
- **Cohort comparison system**: Compare any two datasets via simple UI
- **Extensible metrics framework**: Plugin architecture for new analysis types
- **TWIC integration**: Tournament-quality human games (2000+ rated)
- **Scaled dataset**: ~2000 games total (984 Leela + 999 TWIC)

### 🏗️ Architecture Changes  
- **New modules**: `cohorts/`, `metrics/` for pluggable analysis
- **Data pipeline**: Multi-source collection (Lichess API + TWIC archives)
- **Configuration system**: YAML-based cohort definitions
- **Streamlined UI**: Two-dropdown comparison interface

### 📊 Key Results
- **Leela vs Strong Humans**: 0.079 vs 0.130 median SPBTS (-0.051 difference)
- **Strong statistical power**: 65% effect size across ~2000 games
- **Data diversity**: 140 Leela players, 795 tournament players

### 🧹 Removed
- Old single-purpose `app.py` → `app_cohorts.py` 
- Demo generation script → `manage_cohorts.py`
- Hard-coded analysis modes → flexible cohort system

### 🛠️ Updated
- Makefile with cohort commands (`make cohorts`, `make status`)
- README with new workflow and architecture
- CLAUDE.md with updated commands

### 🚀 Future Ready
- Plugin system for new metrics (opening diversity, tactics, etc.)
- Multi-source data collection framework
- Extensible comparison engine

**Breaking Changes**: UI completely redesigned, but all core functionality preserved and enhanced.

**Migration**: Run `make cohorts` to process data, then `make dev` for new interface.
